# PLAY GAMES MADE IN PYTHON



### Why games in python?

Pygame, is a python game engine. A game is a tool that  makes game development easier, such as gravity detection,
animations, etc.

Pygame has none of the game engine's attributes, and it's  rarely used for commercial games.

At most of the time, pygame is perfect to learn how to code and create systems on your own. By this repository,
we will learn to program good games in general. And maybe, later learn new game engines or other tools easier.

### Install Pygame

Set on the repository you're going to work, and, using the promp, type
pip install pygame.
